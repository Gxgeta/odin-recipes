Odin Recipes 'project'

First was writing a functional html that has link that open new htmls.

The related html were recipes that I like(d) second step was I had to mage page with :
an img, ul, and ol elements added to the normal texts and headers

Learned a few things about CSS so the new step was to add somekind of color to the page(s)

Learned more about CSS now I made the "box" elemtents dislay as I wanted.
Centered some things or made it more spacious to be more readable. (2024.04.07)
