Odin Recipes 'project'

First was writing a functional html that has link that open new htmls.
The related html were recipes that I like(d) 

Second step was I had to mage page with :an img, ul, and ol elements 
added to the normal texts and headers.

Learned a few things about CSS so the new step was to add sometype of color to the page(s)

Learned more about CSS, now I made the "box" elemtents display as I wanted.
Centered some lists and made it more spacious to be more readable. (2024.04.07)

--Fixed some typos

Centered images and added background color to them.
Resized/croped an image with resizeing and "object-fit:cover"(pancake img).(04.08)
